# Arknoid
#### Arkanoid is a block breaker video game
During the Object Oriented Programming course, I developed my own version of the game in Java.
The game includes:
1. Scoreboard.
2. Stages of varying degrees of difficulty with surprises: bricks that break only after X times of hit, bricks that add balls, bricks that change speed.
3. Menu- for navigation.


Although I am not a designer, I clearly liked Batman.
