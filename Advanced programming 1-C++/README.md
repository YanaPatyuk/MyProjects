# Reversi
> Reversi is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8Ã—8 uncheckered board.
There are sixty-four identical game pieces called disks (often spelled "discs"), which are light on one side and dark on the other. Players take turns placing disks on the board with their assigned color facing up. During a play, any disks of the opponent's color that are in a straight line and bounded by the disk just placed and another disk of the current player's color are turned over to the current player's color. The object of the game is to have the majority of disks turned to display your color when the last playable empty square is filled.


During the advanced programming course, Me and my partner, developed the game in C ++.

In the game itself, there are 3 game options.
1. A player vs. a local player.
2. Player vs. Computer (AI)
3. Player vs. Other Player vs. Server.
In the final version of the project, a server was also developed that allows a game to be played between two different users.
The connection to the server and the commands are done via TCP communication.
